# Breast Cancer Treatment Response Prediction

This project aims to predict the response to breast cancer treatment using machine learning techniques. The goal is to preprocess and prepare the dataset for model training by handling missing values, removing outliers, and scaling features. The ultimate aim is to build models that can classify treatment response and predict relapse-free survival (RFS) based on various medical and genetic features.

## Dependencies

To run this project, you need to install the following dependencies using pip:

```bash
pip install scikit-learn numpy pandas scipy xlrd
```

## Preprocessing Steps

1. **Load Dataset**
   - Use `pandas.read_excel()` to load `TrainDataset2024.xls`.
   - **Targets**:
     - `pCR (outcome)` for classification.
     - `RelapseFreeSurvival (outcome)` for regression.
   - **Features**: All other columns except `ID` and target columns.

2. **Handle Missing Data**
   - **Categorical**: Fill with the mode using `SimpleImputer(strategy="most_frequent")`.
   - **Numerical**: Fill with the mean using `SimpleImputer(strategy="mean")`.

3. **Outlier Removal**
   - Detect using Z-scores. Remove rows with numerical features having |Z| > 3.

4. **Feature Scaling**
   - Standardize numerical features to have a mean of 0 and standard deviation of 1 using `StandardScaler`.

5. **Dimensionality Reduction**
   - Apply PCA with `n_components=3` to retain principal components (`PC1`, `PC2`, `PC3`).

6. **Label Encoding**
   - Encode categorical columns (`ER`, `HER2`, `Gene`) using `LabelEncoder`.

7. **Final Dataset**
   - Include: PCA features (`PC1`, `PC2`, `PC3`), encoded categorical features (`ER`, `HER2`, `Gene`), and target variables.

## **Feature Selection**
In this section, we will explore techniques to identify and select the most important features that contribute to the prediction of the target variables (**pCR** and **RelapseFreeSurvival**). Feature selection helps improve the efficiency and accuracy of the model by removing irrelevant or redundant features.

## **Classification (for pCR prediction)**
This section will cover how to apply machine learning classification techniques to predict the **pCR (pathologic complete response)** outcome. We will explore various classification algorithms, such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines (SVM).

## **Regression (for Relapse-Free Survival prediction)**
In this section, we will implement regression algorithms to predict **Relapse-Free Survival (RFS)**, a continuous variable. We will evaluate different regression models like Linear Regression, Random Forest Regressor, and Gradient Boosting Regressor.

## **Model Evaluation**
Model evaluation is crucial to assess the performance of the classification and regression models. In this section, we will use appropriate evaluation metrics like Accuracy, Precision, Recall, and F1-Score for classification tasks, and Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-Squared for regression tasks.

## **Model Tuning**
To improve the performance of the models, we will explore hyperparameter tuning techniques such as Grid Search and Randomized Search to find the optimal settings for the machine learning algorithms.

## **Conclusion**
In the conclusion, we will summarize the findings from the models, reflect on their performance, and provide recommendations for further research or improvements.
